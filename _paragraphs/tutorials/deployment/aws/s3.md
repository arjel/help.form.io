Before we setup our API and PDF servers, we need to first setup an S3 Bucket which will contain the uploaded PDF's used by the PDF server.

 - To setup an S3 bucket, we will first just navigate to the S3 section of Amazon AWS by clicking on the home page, and then typing **S3** in the Search bar. Click on **S3** in the Search results.

 - On the next page, click on the **Create Bucket** button.
 - On the next page, give it a **Bucket Name** of **pdf-server**, and then click **Next**
 - Now skip over the **Configure Options** page by pressing **Next**
 - Now skip over the **Set permissions** page by pressing **Next**
 - Finally, press **Create Bucket** to create your new S3 bucket.
 - Now that we have an S3 bucket created, we now need to create an **IAM** role with admin rights to this S3 bucket. We will do this by navigating back to the AWS homepage and then typing **IAM** in the Search bar.

 - Within the **IAM** page, we will create a new user by clicking on **Users** and then clicking on **Add User**.

    ![](/assets/img/integrations/aws/eb/adduser.jpg){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }

 - In the next page, we will call our User **pdf-server**, and we will want to make sure to check the **Programmatic Access** under the Access Type section. Then click the **Next** button.

 - In the **Permissions** page, we will want to **Attach existing policies directly**, and then we will want to **Create Policy**.

    ![](/assets/img/integrations/aws/eb/attach-policy.jpg){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }

 - This will open up the "Create Policy" page. In this page, we will first want to click on **Choose a service**. Select **S3**.

 - Skip over the **Actions** section.

    ![](/assets/img/integrations/aws/eb/policy-actions.jpg){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }

 - In the next **Resources** section, we will want to click on the **Add ARN** link next to the **bucket** section. Here we will provide our **pdf-server** bucket in the name, and then click **Add**

    ![](/assets/img/integrations/aws/eb/s3-arn.jpg){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }

 - In the **object** resource section, click **Add ARN** and then provide the **pdf-server** bucket name, and then click on the **Any** checkbox for the **object** section.

    ![](/assets/img/integrations/aws/eb/s3-object.jpg){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }

 - For the other **Resources**, click on them and then click on the **Any** settings for all of them. When you are done, it should look like the following.

    ![](/assets/img/integrations/aws/eb/s3-resources.jpg){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }

 - You can now click on the **Review Policy** button at the bottom of the page.
 - For the **Name**, just provide **pdf-server-s3**, then click on the **Create policy** button.

    ![](/assets/img/integrations/aws/eb/s3-policy.jpg){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }

 - Now that a policy has been created, we can attach that policy to the **IAM** role by going back to that page and then search for **pdf-server-s3** in the search bar.

    ![](/assets/img/integrations/aws/eb/user-policy.jpg){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }

 - Now, click on the **Next** button in the **IAM** wizard. Skip ahead until you get to the **Review** page, and then click **Create user**
 - On the next page, make sure to copy the **Access Key ID** as well as the **Secret access key**, and save this for later. We are now ready to move onto setting up the **Elastic Beanstalk** deployment!
