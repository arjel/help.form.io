Docker instances are run inside a Docker Engine. There are many options for where and how to run a docker instance. Depending on which Docker Engine you are using, the formio server configuration will be different. You can see our config options using Environment Variables in the Config Options section of the help.

Our docker image are located on docker hub in public repos. You will need a license in order to run the server.
