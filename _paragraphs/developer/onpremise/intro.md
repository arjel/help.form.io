The form.io platform can be entirely installed on premise within a cloud environment or within your own data center. The platform is very flexible and offers many options for how to architect and configure it. Please contact sales@form.io at any time to discuss your specific needs in architecting a solution.

At a high level the form.io platform consists of two docker containers that contain node.js programs that serve an API and Single Page Application (SPA).
