<span class="alert alert-danger">These instructions are for the 6.x formio-enterprise release and before. If you are using 7.x or later, please go to the [new documentation](/developer/onpremise/)</span>

On-Premise Environments allow running our full API server in your own environment. This will allow having all the form definitions, form data and your project users completely within your own data center or private cloud. On premise deployments are for companies and organizations that do not want or cannot store their data in the cloud.

Environments can be used with projects that are on the **Team Pro or Enterprise** plan with an additional on premise License.
