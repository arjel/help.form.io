One you configure your deployment to enable the [Deployed Portal]({{ site.baseUrl }}/developer/onpremise/#portal), the next thing you may wish to accomplish is to use your **Single-Sign-On** to authenticate into the Deployed developer interface. Our portal interfaces currently support **SAML** authentication into our deployed portal interfaces for both the Developer portal seen @ https://portal.form.io as well as our [Form Manager]({{ site.baseUrl }}/userguide/manager) portal application.

We will cover setting up Single Sign On for the Deployed portal first.
